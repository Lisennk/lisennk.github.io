                Hi, my name is Taras Pohrebniak.
            </h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle">
                I'm a product manager, developer, and author. <br>Since 2017, my passion has been in AI and digital mental health.

                <p>
In 2017, I went through a severe depression for the first time. I discovered that it's not one of those challenges that "make us stronger." It makes you weaker, without providing anything in return.                </p>
                <p>
Overall, 67.5% of people who suffer from mental health issues do not get help. I want to build a solution to this problem and help everyone who fights the darkness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently I am CEO at
                    <a href="https://elomia.com">Elomia Health</a>, where our <b>long-term</b> goal is to create an AI-powered companion that can provide therapy on a human level.

                            In 2017 I founded an online marketplace that  makes it easier and cheaper for people looking for a therapist to find one. The service matched therapists with patients and provided billing and telemedicine solutions.

                            I built a decentralized P2P messenger with 2048 bit RSA encryption. It works in browser and written in just 50 lines of JavaScript. No installation, no login, no databases. Just copy a repository from GitHub and you are ready to go.
