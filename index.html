                Hi, my name is Taras Pohrebniak.

                <p>
In 2017, I went through a severe depression for the first time. Therapy let me heal and move forward, and gave me a new passion: helping others like me. Since then, I've dedicated my life to helping solve the mental health crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, I am the CEO of
                    <a href="https://elomia.com">Elomia Health</a>, where our long-term goal is to develop an AI that will be as effective as traditional therapy. We believe we can achieve this by 2030 or earlier.

                            Before starting Elomia, I founded a mental health platform that offered online counseling for adolescents. The service was built around an algorithm we developed to match patients with therapists, aiming to increase the probability of finding the right fit.
